# This is my mock up website using NextJS and React

# In this project there are a few notable features:
- Dynamic navbar that changes appearance depending on screen size
- Text typing animation to give it a unique appearance
- File download for resume
- Dynamic tabs for skills, education, and qualifications
- Contact form (data is printed to console, needs email API for functionality)

# To give this a try on your local machine here are the steps:
1. Clone the repository into the IDE of your choice (make sure that it is compatible with React)
2. Ensure that you are in the right directory in the terminal: ../animationTest
3. Type "npm install" to install necessary dependencies
4. To run the program run this command in terminal: npm run dev
5. Open a browser and type this URL: localhost:3000
